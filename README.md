# Riot Backend-challenge

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>=18.0.0)

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Serve the app

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

Will run all tests (unit and end-to-end).

To run only unit tests:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

To run only end-to-end tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

The end-to-end test will perform actual actions against the API and requires the server to be running.

## API

### Get the total MRR for a month

```bash
GET /mrr/total
```

#### Query parameters

| Name       | Type     | Description                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `month`    | `string` | **Required**. The month to get. Any of `Jan 22`, `Feb 22` or `Mar 22`.             |
| `currency` | `string` | **Required**. The currency to filter by result. Only supports `usd` at the moment. |

#### HTTP response status codes

| Status Code | Description         |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| `200`       | OK.                 |
| `400`       | Invalid parameters. |

#### Response body

```json
{
  "total": "$443.12"
}
```

### Get the MRR evolution for a subscription between a month and the previous one (difference between the two)

```bash
GET /mrr/evolution
```

#### Query parameters

| Name             | Type     | Description                                                            |

| `subscriptionId` | `string` | **Required**. The subscription id.                                     |

#### HTTP response status codes

#### Response body

```json
{
  "difference": "-$47.88"
}
```

## Original README

Hi there!

Since you got here, you're probably taking a part in our recruitment process for Back-end developer position, right?

We're super happy to hear that! Getting right to it ‚Äî the main purpose of this test is to check out your backend and solving problems skills. We'd like to get to know your approach of solving the following problems:

- Understand specs requirements.
- Manipulate Data structure.
- Create a small API in Node.js.

Feel free to open an issue if you got any questions or suggestions! Once it's ready, send us a repository link at louis@tryriot.com.

Happy coding and cheers,

Louis, CTO @ Riot

### Exercise : MRR Compute Service

#### Problem

[MRR](<https://support.stripe.com/questions/understanding-monthly-recurring-revenue-(mrr)?>) (monthly recurring revenue) is **THE MOST IMPORTANT METRICS** for Software as a Service company (SaaS). As you may have guessed [Riot](https://tryriot.com) is a SaaS company working in Cybersecurity.

üö® Hint: Take some time to read carefully üëÜ how to compute the MRR the right way!

Your mission is:

1. To be able to compute the total MRR by month for all subscriptions in dollars ($) from this API. The API response changes its response everytime to emulate the time passing by ‚è∞.
2. To be able to show the MRR difference from the past month for each subscription and every month.
3. To write a small API to get those results.

```curl
curl --request GET \
  --url https://fake-subscriptions-api.fly.dev/api/subscriptions
```

#### Clarifications

- For the sake of the problem, persistence is not mandatory.
- use at least Node.js + Typescript
- Unless you have a strong preference otherwise, just use a simple webserver like Express.
- You should optimize for both readability of your code and performance.
- Tests are not mandatory but highly encouraged.
- All values will be rounded to the nearest integer.
- `items` represents the module subscribed for this subscriptions.
- `quantity` represents the number of seats for this module.
- `unit_amount` value are representing the price of the module in cents.
- `status` represents the subscription status, `active` subscription should be included in the MRR compute.

#### Example

```json
// For the following subscription the MRR is : 39.90$
{
    "id": "sub-1",
    "status": "active",
    "items" : [
        {
            "id": "sub-1-item-1",
            "module": "awareness",
            "unit_amount": 3990,
            "quantity": 12
        }],
    "interval": "yearly",
    "currency": "usd",
    "percent_off": 0
},
```

```json
// For the following subscription the MRR is : 359.1$
{
    "id": "sub-1",
    "status": "active",
    "items" : [
        {
            "id": "sub-1-item-1",
            "module": "awareness",
            "unit_amount": 399,
            "quantity": 100
        }],
    "interval": "monthly",
    "currency": "usd",
    "percent_off": 10
},
```
